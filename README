USAGE NOTES
===========

Installation:

1) Place this plugin (as a directory named 'children_by_part' with all contents) in the Wolf /wolf/plugins directory.
2) Activate the plugin through the administration screen.

Usage:

children_by_part([parent-page], [page-part name], [order], [#]) :
  [parent-page] = the URI/identity of the page the children of which will be sorted:
                  examples: $this, find_page_by_uri('/slug/')
  [page-part name] = the name of the page-part (not "body"!) to be sorted
  [order] = can be ASC or DESC
  [#] = the number of pages to be returned

Example:

The page called "Events" (slug = events) has a number of child pages, each with a page part called "date". The following code, used on the "Events" page, will give a date-ordered listing of the child pages, with a link to the sub-page:

[example]
<h3>Event Dates</h3>

<?php foreach (children_by_part($this,'date') as $event): ?>
<h4><?php echo $event->link(),',&nbsp;',$event->content('date'); ?></h4>
<hr />
<?php endforeach ?>
[/example]

That will return all child pages which have the 'date' page-part.
